# Emacs Config: Agent Guide (AGENTS.md)

This directory is an Emacs configuration intended to be symlinked into
`~/.config/emacs/` (or wherever `user-emacs-directory` points). The canonical
source lives in this dotfiles repo; `init.el` is a thin entrypoint that locates
the *real* directory and loads the rest.

Use this document as the operating manual when making changes with an automated
agent (LLM) or when you want to understand the configuration structure.

## Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:

- Keep `init.el` small, readable, and stable.
- Put behavior into small, single-purpose modules.
- Be robust when `init.el` is symlinked (load modules from the real path).
- Prefer explicit, predictable defaults over heavy abstractions.
- Support both GUI Emacs and terminal Emacs (TTY), with a strong TTY baseline.

Non-goals:

- This is not a full distribution (Doom/Spacemacs). Avoid introducing a large
  framework unless explicitly requested.
- `custom.el` is not treated as a source-of-truth. Prefer code changes.

## Repository Layout

Key files:

- `init.el`
  - User entrypoint.
  - Sets basic, early globals (no backups/autosaves, menu bar off, etc.).
  - Loads `emacs-config-core.el`.
  - Loads optional local modules via `emacs-config-load-module`.

- `emacs-config-core.el`
  - Bootstrapping and wiring.
  - Computes `emacs-config-dir` (real directory even when symlinked).
  - Defines `emacs-config-load-module` (safe local module loader).
  - Redirects Customize writes to `custom.el` (but does not auto-load it).
  - Bootstraps `straight.el` and installs/enables `use-package`.

- `custom.el`
  - Written by Emacs Customize UI.
  - Not auto-loaded.

Local modules loaded from `init.el` (via `emacs-config-load-module`):

- `completion.el`: minibuffer completion UI (Fido vertical / icomplete).
- `csi-u-keys.el`: terminal key decoding for CSI-u sequences.
- `git-gutter-tty.el`: VCS gutter indicators in terminal frames.
- `lsp-core.el`: shared LSP configuration (`lsp-mode`, `lsp-ui`).
- `lsp-python.el`: Python LSP via `lsp-pyright` (configured for basedpyright).
- `lsp-web.el`: JS/TS LSP (`typescript-mode`, built-in `js`).
- `lsp-ltex-plus-config.el`: LTEX+ grammar/spell checks via `lsp-ltex-plus`.
- `zac-theme-autodetection.el`: theme auto-switch based on external appearance.

## Boot Sequence (Mental Model)

1. Emacs loads `init.el` from `user-emacs-directory`.
2. `init.el` resolves its *true* location (works through symlinks).
3. `init.el` loads `emacs-config-core.el`.
4. `emacs-config-core.el`:
   - sets `emacs-config-dir`
   - defines `emacs-config-load-module`
   - configures `custom-file` to `custom.el`
   - bootstraps `straight.el` and enables `use-package`
5. Back in `init.el`, packages and modules are configured.
6. Optional modules are loaded with warnings on failure (no hard crash unless
   the failure is in core wiring).

## Package Management

This config uses:

- `straight.el` as the package manager.
- `use-package` as the configuration macro.

Conventions:

- Prefer `use-package` for third-party packages.
- Use `:straight nil` for built-in packages.
- Modules should be loadable on their own once `emacs-config-core.el` has run.
- Keep package pinning/versioning decisions explicit if introduced.

Notes:

- Bootstrapping downloads `straight.el` from GitHub the first time.
- If you are modifying this config in an offline environment, avoid adding new
  packages that require immediate downloads, unless you also provide an
  offline-friendly path.

## Customize (`custom.el`)

`emacs-config-core.el` sets:

- `custom-file` => `custom.el` (in this directory)

and intentionally does **not** load it automatically.

Implications:

- Do not add hand-edits to `custom.el` as part of a feature. Prefer editing
  `init.el` or a module.
- If you need a Customize setting to take effect, either:
  - implement it in code, or
  - explicitly load `custom-file` (but that is a design change; do it only when
    requested).

## Local Module Pattern

When adding or editing modules, match the existing style:

- File header uses lexical binding:

  ```elisp
  ;;; my-module.el --- One-line description -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ```

- End with:

  ```elisp
  (provide 'my-module)
  ;;; my-module.el ends here
  ```

- Keep a module narrowly focused.
- Prefer `emacs-config-load-module` from `init.el` for optional behavior.
  It emits a warning instead of aborting startup.

`emacs-config-load-module` expects a file named after the module symbol, e.g.:

- `(emacs-config-load-module 'completion "...")` loads `completion.el`.

## Platform / Frame-Type Specific Behavior

TTY vs GUI:

- Clipboard helpers are conditional:
  - macOS terminal Emacs uses `pbcopy` package to sync clipboard.
  - Linux terminal Emacs uses `xclip` package.
- `git-gutter-tty.el` is explicitly for terminal frames (`(not window-system)`).
- Mouse wheel support in TTY is enabled via built-in `mouse` / `xterm-mouse-mode`.

macOS / Linux:

- Theme auto-detection (`zac-theme-autodetection.el`) reads a state file written
  by an external tool and uses file notification APIs when available.

## External Dependencies (Non-ELisp)

These modules expect external programs on `PATH`:

- Python LSP (`lsp-python.el`):
  - `basedpyright` (configured via `lsp-pyright-langserver-command`)

- JS/TS LSP (`lsp-web.el`):
  - `typescript-language-server`
  - `tsserver` (typically from `typescript` npm package)

- LTEX+ (`lsp-ltex-plus-config.el`):
  - `ltex-ls-plus` (Java-based server)

If any of these are missing, Emacs may still start but language features will
not work; the intent is graceful degradation.

## Theme Auto-Detection

`zac-theme-autodetection.el` integrates with:

- `zsh-appearance-control` (external)

It watches an `appearance` file that contains:

- `"1"` => dark -> Catppuccin `macchiato`
- `"0"` => light -> Catppuccin `frappe`

Paths:

- `$ZAC_CACHE_DIR/appearance` if `ZAC_CACHE_DIR` is set
- else `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/zac/appearance`
- else `~/.cache/zac/appearance`

Design choice:

- It disables any currently enabled themes and reloads Catppuccin.
- It sets some faces to `unspecified-bg` for terminal/GUI consistency.

## LTEX+ Module Notes

`lsp-ltex-plus-config.el` contains non-trivial glue code to:

- ensure `_ltex.*` commands are executed against the LTEX+ workspace (buffers
  may have multiple LSP workspaces, e.g. TeX + LTEX+)
- trigger a one-shot check on open so diagnostics appear immediately
- handle `emacs --daemon` / `emacsclient` where buffers can persist
- nudge Flymake rendering when diagnostics timing is awkward

If you change this module, preserve those invariants unless explicitly
requested.

## Common Tasks

Add a new optional module:

1. Create `my-feature.el` following the module pattern.
2. In `init.el`, add:

   ```elisp
   (emacs-config-load-module
    'my-feature
    "Could not load my-feature.el; <feature> is disabled.")
   ```

3. Prefer to keep the module self-contained with its `use-package` declarations.

Add a new package:

- Use `use-package` in the relevant module.
- Avoid adding packages directly in `init.el` unless it is truly core.

Move configuration from `init.el` into a module:

- Keep `init.el` as a readable table-of-contents.
- Put the logic behind an `emacs-config-load-module` call.

## Validation / Smoke Tests

The most useful checks after changes:

- Interactive startup with debug:
  - `emacs --debug-init`

- Batch load (useful for CI-like smoke checks):
  - `emacs --batch --quick -l init.el --eval "(message \"init loaded\")"`

Notes:

- First-time runs may download packages via straight.
- Some features only activate in terminal frames or in specific major modes.

## Agent Rules (How to Work in This Repo)

When acting as an automated agent editing this configuration:

- Preserve the symlink-aware loading design. Do not introduce hard-coded
  absolute paths outside of `emacs-config-dir` unless there is a strong reason.
- Keep `init.el` compact. Prefer adding/changing local modules.
- Avoid editing `custom.el` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer graceful degradation: optional modules should fail with warnings, not
  break startup.
- Keep Elisp style consistent:
  - `lexical-binding: t`
  - minimal, purposeful comments
  - `provide` at the end of each module
